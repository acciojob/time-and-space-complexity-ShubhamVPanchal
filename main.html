	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It helps us analyze and compare the efficiency of different algorithms. An efficient algorithm has lower time complexity, meaning it solves problems faster with fewer resources. Understanding time complexity is key to writing optimized and scalable code.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. It includes memory for input, output, and auxiliary space. For example, if an algorithm stores 'n' elements, its space complexity is O(n). This means the memory required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
